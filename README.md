# JS-Recursion

My solutions to the [fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence) and [merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)!

## Summary

These solutions are my first time using recursion and it was pretty challenging for me. I have a better idea of what recursion is and I feel more comfortable with my Javascript skills now that I took the time to learn it.
